# Changelog

## 0.2.0

* The API endpoint has been updated, so this release updates the API endpoint to the legacy.
* Updates the way the incoming XML is parsed, so more fields are available from the raw API response. It's also easier to parse using a different method from `ox` than before.
* No longer supports Ruby 2.2, it's out of support life.

## Previous versions

Implements GetGamesList, GetGame, GetArt, GetPlatformsList, GetPlatform, GetPlatformGames, PlatformGames from the original API.
